        I am currently a software developer with one of the largest credit
        unions in Washington State. We make quality, full-stack applications to
        help our members address their financial needs through digital channels.
        I have experience with technologies such as Angular, .NET, SQL, and
        Azure. In my free time I have also experimented with React, Node.js, and
        MongoDB. I am always looking to learn new technologies and improve my
        skills. My focus at the moment has been in full-stack web development,
        however I do enjoy lower level programming as well. I have academic
        experience with C++, Java, and Assembly. Speaking of academics, I am a
        graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science from
        <a href="https://www.whitworth.edu/cms/"
          ><strong>Whitworth University</strong></a
        >.

        In my free time I enjoy playing video games, skiing, and doing Kendo. I
        make my own espresso and I am currently working on a project to log the
        coffee roasts for different beans that I have tried over the years. I
        have two cats named Mittens and Oliver who are quite a handful. If you
        like you can see them in the gallery.
