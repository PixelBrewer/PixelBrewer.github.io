        I am currently a software developer with one of the largest credit unions in Washington State. 
        We make quality, full-stack applications to help our members address their financial needs through digital channels. 
        I have experience with technologies such as Angular, .NET, SQL, and Azure. In my free time I have also experimented with
        React, Node.js, and MongoDB. I am always looking to learn new technologies and improve my skills.

        My focus at the moment has been in full-stack web development, however I do enjoy lower level programming as well. I have
        academic experience with C++, Java, and Assembly. Speaking of academics, I am a graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science from 
        <a href="https://www.whitworth.edu/cms/">Whitworth University</a>.

        In my free time I enjoy playing video games, skiing, and doing Kendo. I make my own espresso and I am currently working on a project to 
        log the coffee roasts for different beans that I have tried over the years. I have two cats named Mittens and Oliver who are quite a handful.
        If you like you can see them in the gallery.
